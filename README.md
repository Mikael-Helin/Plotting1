# Plotting1

I find R to be a slow language or maybe I do not know the tricks. Anyways, the data file household_power_consumption.txt is too large, bogs down the speed of my computer.

Run first the script run_me_first.R to create the smaller data file mydata.txt. Remark: You need to unzip household_power_consumption.txt.gz first.

There after, as insctructions tell, run
plot1.R
plot2.R
plot3.R
plot4.R

to obtain corresponding PNG plots
